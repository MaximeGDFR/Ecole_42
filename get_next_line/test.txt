Hello, World!
This is a test of the get_next_line function.

Let's check different cases:
- Lines with spaces
- Lines with punctuation, like commas, periods, and exclamation marks!

Here is a line that is quite long to ensure that the buffer needs to handle more than its default size and tests how get_next_line manages larger inputs without any line breaks in between until it reaches the end.

1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

End of test.
